# File_encryptor_and_hash_calculator

This simple program will encrypt a text file using simple substitution cipher. With a key space of 26 it is not secure. It was made to demonstrate how cryptography works.
Moreover this program calculates hashes of the file and prints it in a hex digest.
available algorithms are MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256.

Usage :

Entering the complete path to the file is recommended.  (e.g. C:\ProgramFiles\file.txt)
to hash the file input the complete path to the file (e.g. C:\ProgramFiles\file.txt)

P.S. :- The encrypted file will be created in the same directory where the program is being executed.
